End-to-end movie ratings analysis using Python and Power BI

Movie Ratings Analysis & Visualization
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing movie ratings data to uncover patterns in audience preferences, genre performance, and rating trends over time. The analysis combines Python-based data analysis with an interactive Power BI dashboard to present insights clearly and effectively.

This project was completed as part of my Data Science Internship at Hex Softwares.

Objectives:

Clean and preprocess movie ratings data

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode)

Identify top-rated movies and genres

Visualize insights using Python and Power BI

Build an interactive dashboard for presentation

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Google Colab

Power BI

GitHub

Data Exploration & Cleaning

Selected relevant features (title, rating, votes, genre, year)

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Converted data types for analysis and visualization

Created a clean dataset suitable for Power BI dashboards

Analysis Performed

Summary statistics of IMDB ratings

Distribution analysis using histograms and boxplots

Identification of top-rated movies based on ratings and votes

Genre-wise average rating analysis
